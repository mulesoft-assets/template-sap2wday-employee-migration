        <section id="use_case">
As a SAP admin I want to migrate employees to Workday.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating Employees from SAP instance to Workday, being able to specify available filtering criteria and desired behavior when an employee already exists in the destination system.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

Before the *Process* stage the Anypoint Template will go to the SAP and query all the employees that match the filtering criteria. The criteria is based on available filtering fields for standard BAPI BAPI_EMPLOYEE_GETDATA. 

During the *Process* stage the template checks if there is an employee with such an id in the Workday and if it is present the template will update it using Change_Preferred_Name function, if it isn't - the template creates it using HIRE_EMPLOYEE function call.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will both log output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose `sapemployeemigration` as domain name to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sapemployeemigration.cloudhub.io/migrateemployees` and report will be sent to the email configured.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local HTTP Listener with the port you configured in the properties file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/migrateemployees` and this will output a summary report and send it in the email.

This is the file where you will find the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Anypoint Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiceExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
For the purpose of this particular Anypoint Template the *triggerFlow* executes the Batch Job in *businessLogic.xml* which handles all the logic of it.

$H$H#  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateemployees` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Employees migrated and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml).
2. During the *Process* stage, each Employee will be filtered depending on existing of matching Employee in the Workday instance. The matching is performed by querying a Workday instance for an entry with the given External Reference ID.
3. The next step will insert a new record into the Workday instance if there was none found in the previous step or update it if there was found matching employee.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console and send report to an email you choose.
